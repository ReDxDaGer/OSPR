NIST practices
---
Perform a risk assessment
Create a security policy
Physical security measures
Human resources security measures
Perform and test backups
Maintain security patches and updates
Employ access controls
Regularly test incident response
Implement a network monitorning analytics and management tool
Implement network security devices
Implement a comprehensive endpoint security solution (antimalware)
Encrypt data

Types of firewalls
---
Network layer firewall (IP-based)
Transport layer firewall (port-based)
Application layer firewall (Application-based)
Context aware layer firewall (user/device-based)
Proxy server (web-server based)
Reverse proxy server 
Network address Translation (NAT) Firewall (prevents leakage of IP)
Host based-firewall (on-host firewall)

Security playbook
---
Identify and automate response to threats
describe in-going and out-going traffic
trends, statitics,counts
quick access to statistics and metric
correlate events across all relevant data sources

System information & Event management (SIEM) system
---
collects and analyzes (alerts, logs, real-time/historical data)

Data loss prevention system
---
stops leakage/takeaway of sensitive data

Internet Standard
---
all devices connecting to the network implement the same set of rules or protocols in the same manner

Release of new standards
---
Every stage recorded in RFC
RFCs published and managed by IETF

Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) 
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
Institute of Electircal and Electronics Engineering

Layered Models
---
Visualise how various protocols work in symphony for network communication
visualisation multiple protocols 

Protocol models
---
set of protocols 
protocols are layers

Reference models
---
Functions that must be completed at a particular layer
set of protocols in one layer to acheive layer name

Open systems interconnections (OSI)
made by
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

OSI Vs. TCP/IP
---
TCP/IP model describes the networking functions specific to those protocols in use in the TCP/IP protocol suite.
The functions that occur at the internet layer in the TCP/IP model are contained in the network layer of the OSI Model

TCP/IP Application

Ethernet frame elements:
---
Preamble
Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)
Destination MAC Address
Source MAC Address
Lenght Type
DATA (46-1500 bytes)
Frame check sequence 


Common factors in all communication methods:
MSG source
MSG dest.
Transmission medium

Fibre Optic is used in network backbones
Coaxial is used for connecting satellite parts

Private Addresses (RFC 1918 Ranges)
10.0.0.0 --> 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0 --> 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0 --> 192.168.255.255

Private Address --> Public Address (through Network Address Translation)

IP Address classes
Class A --> N.H.H.H
Class B --> N.N.H.H
Class C --> N.N.N.H
Class D --> Multicast
Class E --> Reserved
