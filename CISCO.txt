NIST practices
---
Perform a risk assessment
Create a security policy
Physical security measures
Human resources security measures
Perform and test backups
Maintain security patches and updates
Employ access controls
Regularly test incident response
Implement a network monitorning analytics and management tool
Implement network security devices
Implement a comprehensive endpoint security solution (antimalware)
Encrypt data

Types of firewalls
---
Network layer firewall (IP-based)
Transport layer firewall (port-based)
Application layer firewall (Application-based)
Context aware layer firewall (user/device-based)
Proxy server (web-server based)
Reverse proxy server 
Network address Translation (NAT) Firewall (prevents leakage of IP)
Host based-firewall (on-host firewall)

Security playbook
---
Identify and automate response to threats
describe in-going and out-going traffic
trends, statitics,counts
quick access to statistics and metric
correlate events across all relevant data sources

System information & Event management (SIEM) system
---
collects and analyzes (alerts, logs, real-time/historical data)

Data loss prevention system
---
stops leakage/takeaway of sensitive data
